# AI_Systems
##### Storage for coursework completed in my AI Systems module.

This programme is a work in progress, with features being subject to change at any given time.

## Genetic Algorithm

My first implementation of a genetic algorithm, using chromosomes and a roulette wheel for random parent selection.


### Warning

This program is coded to produce two children per parent in a generation, please be careful when setting the max generation parameters to values over 10. 

$$ 
\textnormal {population size} = 8 \times 2^n
$$ 

e.g. running only 12 generations of this will require computing: 

$$
8 \times 2^{12} = 32,768
$$
simulated chromosomes, be careful :-)

## Testing

Testing your own population with this programme is not currently supported, but may be in the future.
